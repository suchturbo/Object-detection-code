Object Detection

Object detection helps robots and computers naviagte through obstacles in their way. Without object detection modern day robots would not be able to take a step forward.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

My first milestone came with setting up the actual rasberry pi and all the neccessary components to my monitor. I started off by adding the SD card in and connecting the HDMI cable for my monitor into the rasberry pi. Then I added in the raspi cameras and connected my rasberry pi into VNC which would allow me to stream everything that went on in my rasberry pi into my local computer. I first updated my rasberry pi thourougly in order to run my raspi camera. To my surprise my raspi camera did not work and even the second one after that did not work either. After all this I just used my personal webcam and hooked it up into my rasberry pi. I downloaded models which my code would scan for. After I ran a couple of models I ended with approximately 70% accuracy. With my webcam working I decided to move onto the next step.
